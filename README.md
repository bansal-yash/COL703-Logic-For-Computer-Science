# COL703-Logic-For-Computer-Science
Course assignments of COL703:- Logic for Computer Science course at IIT Delhi under Professor Vaishnavi Sundararajan

This repository contains assignments that explore formal methods, proof techniques, and interactive theorem proving using Lean 4. Topics covered include functional programming, inductive datatypes, proof automation, and propositional logic proof systems.

## 📁 Assignments

### [Assignment 1: Introduction to Lean 4](./Assignment_1.lean)
Defined inductive datatypes (`day`, `myList`) and implemented basic functions like `nextWorkingDay` and `myLength`. Proved simple theorems using pattern matching and the `rfl` tactic.

---

### [Assignment 2: Quantification and Proof Tactics](./Assignment_2.lean)
Worked with universal quantification, implications, and conjunctions using tactics like `intro`, `simp`, and `rewrite`. Proved theorems about list operations including prepending and appending through inductive proofs.

---

### [Assignment 3: Advanced List Operations and Type Theory](./Assignment_3.lean)
Implemented list reversal and proved idempotence while exploring dependent types and type classes. Defined total functions with default values and proved properties about list equality.

---

### [Assignment 4: Inductive Predicates and Existential Quantification](./Assignment_4.lean)
Defined inductive predicates for list membership and uniqueness, working with existential quantification and the `obtain` tactic. Proved theorems about membership preservation under list operations.

---

### [Assignment 5: Proof Automation and Tactic Combinators](./Assignment_5.lean)
Introduced automated tactics like `grind` for arithmetic and `repeat` for iterative application. Demonstrated tactic combinators and compared manual vs. automated proof strategies.

---

### [Assignment 6: Propositional Logic Proof System](./Assignment_6.lean)
Defined propositional logic syntax and implemented a proof tree system for intuitionistic logic. Proved the monotonicity property using structural induction on proof trees.

---

Each assignment builds upon previous concepts, progressing from basic functional programming to complex inductive reasoning and formal proof systems using Lean 4.
